Using NextJS to create a full stack application that is optimized for both SEO, client side rendering and server side rendering of components. (Thank you nextjs)

Also I have already broke my app on the init push to github so... idk

If you want to contribute or are looking for examples of some full stack apps check out my other public repo's and reach out on here or email me: cameronpool2019@gmail.com
